Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) Release Notes
###################################################

Overview
=========

The Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) accompanies the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler
and provides high-productivity APIs aimed to minimize programming efforts of C++ developers
creating efficient heterogeneous applications.

New in 2022.9.0
===============

New Features
------------
- Added parallel range algorithms in ``namespace oneapi::dpl::ranges``: ``fill``, ``move``, ``replace``, ``replace_if``,
  ``remove``, ``remove_if``, ``mismatch``, ``minmax_element``, ``min``, ``max``, ``find_first_of``, ``find_end``,
  ``is_sorted_until``. These algorithms operate with C++20 random access ranges.
- Improved performance of set operation algorithms when using device policies: ``set_union``, ``set_difference``,
  ``set_intersection``, ``set_symmetric_difference``.
- Improved performance of ``copy``, ``fill``, ``for_each``, ``replace``, ``reverse``, ``rotate``, ``transform`` and 30+
  other algorithms with device policies on GPUs when using ``std::reverse_iterator``.
- Added ADL-based customization point ``is_onedpl_indirectly_device_accessible``, which can be used to mark iterator
  types as *indirectly device accessible*. Added public trait ``oneapi::dpl::is_directly_device_accessible[_v]`` to
  query if types are indirectly device accessible.

Fixed Issues
------------
- Eliminated runtime exceptions encountered when compiling code that called ``inclusive_scan``, ``copy_if``,
  ``partition``, ``unique``, ``reduce_by_segment``, and related algorithms with device policies using
  the open source oneAPI DPC++ Compiler without specifying an optimization flag.
- Fixed a compilation error in ``reduce_by_segment`` regarding return type deduction when called with a device policy.
- Eliminated multiple compile time warnings throughout the library.

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------
New in This Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The `set_intersection`, `set_difference`, `set_symmetric_difference`, and `set_union` algorithms with a device policy
require GPUs with double-precision support on Windows, regardless of the value type of the input sequences.

Existing Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See oneDPL Guide for other `restrictions and known limitations`_.

- ``histogram`` algorithm requires the output value type to be an integral type no larger than four bytes
  when used with a device policy on hardware that does not support 64-bit atomic operations.
- ``histogram`` may provide incorrect results with device policies in a program built with ``-O0`` option and the driver
  version is 2448.13 or older.
- For ``transform_exclusive_scan`` and ``exclusive_scan`` to run in-place (that is, with the same data
  used for both input and destination) and with an execution policy of ``unseq`` or ``par_unseq``, 
  it is required that the provided input and destination iterators are equality comparable.
  Furthermore, the equality comparison of the input and destination iterator must evaluate to true.
  If these conditions are not met, the result of these algorithm calls is undefined.
- Incorrect results may be produced by ``exclusive_scan``, ``inclusive_scan``, ``transform_exclusive_scan``,
  ``transform_inclusive_scan``, ``exclusive_scan_by_segment``, ``inclusive_scan_by_segment``, ``reduce_by_segment``
  with ``unseq`` or ``par_unseq`` policy when compiled by Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2024.1 or earlier
  with ``-fiopenmp``, ``-fiopenmp-simd``, ``-qopenmp``, ``-qopenmp-simd`` options on Linux.
  To avoid the issue, pass ``-fopenmp`` or ``-fopenmp-simd`` option instead.
- With libstdc++ version 10, the compilation error *SYCL kernel cannot use exceptions* occurs
  when calling the range-based ``adjacent_find``, ``is_sorted`` or ``is_sorted_until`` algorithms with device policies.
- The range-based ``count_if`` may produce incorrect results on Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series when the driver version
  is "Rolling 2507.12" and newer.

New in 2022.8.0
===============

New Features
------------
- Added support of host policies for ``histogram`` algorithms.
- Added support for an undersized output range in the range-based ``merge`` algorithm.
- Improved performance of the ``merge`` and sorting algorithms
  (``sort``, ``stable_sort``, ``sort_by_key``, ``stable_sort_by_key``) that rely on Merge sort [#fnote1]_,
  with device policies for large data sizes.
- Improved performance of ``copy``, ``fill``, ``for_each``, ``replace``, ``reverse``, ``rotate``, ``transform`` and 30+
  other algorithms with device policies on GPUs.
- Improved oneDPL use with SYCL implementations other than Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.


Fixed Issues
------------
- Fixed an issue with ``drop_view`` in the experimental range-based API.
- Fixed compilation errors in ``find_if`` and ``find_if_not`` with device policies where the user provided predicate is
  device copyable but not trivially copyable.
- Fixed incorrect results or synchronous SYCL exceptions for several algorithms when compiled with ``-O0`` and executed
  on a GPU device.
- Fixed an issue preventing inclusion of the ``<numeric>`` header after ``<execution>`` and ``<algorithm>`` headers.
- Fixed several issues in the ``sort``, ``stable_sort``, ``sort_by_key`` and ``stable_sort_by_key`` algorithms that:

   * Allows the use of non-trivially-copyable comparators.
   * Eliminates duplicate kernel names.
   * Resolves incorrect results on devices with sub-group sizes smaller than four.
   * Resolved synchronization errors that were seen on Intel® Arc™ B-series GPU devices.

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------
New in This Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Incorrect results may be observed when calling ``sort`` with a device policy on Intel® Arc™ graphics 140V with data
  sizes of 4-8 million elements on Windows.
  This issue is resolved in
  Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2025.1 or later and Intel® Graphics Driver 32.0.101.6647 or later.
- ``sort``, ``stable_sort``, ``sort_by_key`` and ``stable_sort_by_key`` algorithms fail to compile
  when using Clang 17 and earlier versions, as well as compilers based on these versions,
  such as Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2023.2.0.
- When compiling code that uses device policies with the open source oneAPI DPC++ Compiler (clang++ driver),
  synchronous SYCL runtime exceptions regarding unfound kernels may be encountered unless an optimization flag is
  specified (for example ``-O1``) as opposed to relying on the compiler's default optimization level.

Existing Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See oneDPL Guide for other `restrictions and known limitations`_.

- ``histogram`` algorithm requires the output value type to be an integral type no larger than four bytes
  when used with an FPGA policy.
- ``histogram`` may provide incorrect results with device policies in a program built with ``-O0`` option.
- Compilation issues may be encountered when passing zip iterators to ``exclusive_scan_by_segment`` on Windows.

  used for both input and destination) and with an execution policy of ``unseq`` or ``par_unseq``, 
  it is required that the provided input and destination iterators are equality comparable.
  Furthermore, the equality comparison of the input and destination iterator must evaluate to true.
  If these conditions are not met, the result of these algorithm calls is undefined.

  To avoid the issue, pass ``-fopenmp`` or ``-fopenmp-simd`` option instead.

New in 2022.7.0
===============

New Features
------------
- Improved performance of the ``adjacent_find``, ``all_of``, ``any_of``, ``copy_if``, ``exclusive_scan``, ``equal``,
  ``find``, ``find_if``, ``find_end``, ``find_first_of``, ``find_if_not``, ``inclusive_scan``, ``includes``,
  ``is_heap``, ``is_heap_until``, ``is_partitioned``, ``is_sorted``, ``is_sorted_until``, ``lexicographical_compare``,

  ``stable_partition``, ``transform_exclusive_scan``, ``transform_inclusive_scan``, ``unique``, and ``unique_copy``
  algorithms with device policies. 
- Improved performance of ``sort``, ``stable_sort`` and ``sort_by_key`` algorithms with device policies when using Merge
  sort [#fnote1]_.
- Added ``stable_sort_by_key`` algorithm in ``namespace oneapi::dpl``. 
- Added parallel range algorithms in ``namespace oneapi::dpl::ranges``: ``all_of``, ``any_of``,
  ``none_of``, ``for_each``, ``find``, ``find_if``, ``find_if_not``, ``adjacent_find``, ``search``, ``search_n``,
  ``transform``, ``sort``, ``stable_sort``, ``is_sorted``, ``merge``, ``count``, ``count_if``, ``equal``, ``copy``,
  ``copy_if``, ``min_element``, ``max_element``. These algorithms operate with C++20 random access ranges
  and views while also taking an execution policy similarly to other oneDPL algorithms.
- Added support for operators ==, !=, << and >> for RNG engines and distributions.
- Added experimental support for the Philox RNG engine in ``namespace oneapi::dpl::experimental``.
- Added the ``<oneapi/dpl/version>`` header containing oneDPL version macros and new feature testing macros.

Fixed Issues

- Fixed a build error for ``oneapi::dpl::begin`` and ``oneapi::dpl::end`` functions used with
  the Microsoft* Visual C++ standard library and with C++20.
- Reordered template parameters of the ``histogram`` algorithm to match its function parameter order.
  For affected ``histogram`` calls we recommend to remove explicit specification of template parameters
  and instead add explicit type conversions of the function arguments as necessary.
- ``gpu::esimd::radix_sort`` and ``gpu::esimd::radix_sort_by_key`` kernel templates now throw ``std::bad_alloc``
  if they fail to allocate global memory.
- Fixed a potential hang occurring with ``gpu::esimd::radix_sort`` and
  ``gpu::esimd::radix_sort_by_key`` kernel templates. 
- Fixed documentation for ``sort_by_key`` algorithm, which used to be mistakenly described as stable, despite being
  possibly unstable for some execution policies. If stability is required, use ``stable_sort_by_key`` instead. 
- Fixed an error when calling ``sort`` with device execution policies on CUDA devices.
- Allow passing C++20 random access iterators to oneDPL algorithms.
- Fixed issues caused by initialization of SYCL queues in the predefined device execution policies.
  These policies have been updated to be immutable (``const``) objects.

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------
New in This Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- ``histogram`` may provide incorrect results with device policies in a program built with -O0 option.
- Inclusion of ``<oneapi/dpl/dynamic_selection>`` prior to ``<oneapi/dpl/random>`` may result in compilation errors.
  Include ``<oneapi/dpl/random>`` first as a workaround.
- Incorrect results may occur when using ``oneapi::dpl::experimental::philox_engine`` with no predefined template
  parameters and with `word_size` values other than 64 and 32.
- Incorrect results or a synchronous SYCL exception may be observed with the following algorithms built
  with -O0 option and executed on a GPU device: ``exclusive_scan``, ``inclusive_scan``, ``transform_exclusive_scan``,
  ``transform_inclusive_scan``, ``copy_if``, ``remove``, ``remove_copy``, ``remove_copy_if``, ``remove_if``,
  ``partition``, ``partition_copy``, ``stable_partition``, ``unique``, ``unique_copy``, and ``sort``.
- The value type of the input sequence should be convertible to the type of the initial element for the following
  algorithms with device execution policies: ``transform_inclusive_scan``, ``transform_exclusive_scan``,
  ``inclusive_scan``, and ``exclusive_scan``.
- The following algorithms with device execution policies may exceed the C++ standard requirements on the number
  of applications of user-provided predicates or equality operators: ``copy_if``, ``remove``, ``remove_copy``,
  ``remove_copy_if``, ``remove_if``, ``partition_copy``, ``unique``, and ``unique_copy``. In all cases,
  the predicate or equality operator is applied ``O(n)`` times.
- The ``adjacent_find``, ``all_of``, ``any_of``, ``equal``, ``find``, ``find_if``, ``find_end``, ``find_first_of``,
  ``find_if_not``, ``includes``, ``is_heap``, ``is_heap_until``, ``is_sorted``, ``is_sorted_until``, ``mismatch``,
  ``none_of``, ``search``, and ``search_n`` algorithms may cause a segmentation fault when used with a device execution
  policy on a CPU device, and built on Linux with Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2025.0.0 and -O0 -g compiler options.

- Compilation issues may be encountered when passing zip iterators to ``exclusive_scan_by_segment`` on Windows.
- Incorrect results may be produced by ``set_intersection`` with a DPC++ execution policy,
  where elements are copied from the second input range rather than the first input range. 
- For ``transform_exclusive_scan`` and ``exclusive_scan`` to run in-place (that is, with the same data
  used for both input and destination) and with an execution policy of ``unseq`` or ``par_unseq``, 
  it is required that the provided input and destination iterators are equality comparable.
  Furthermore, the equality comparison of the input and destination iterator must evaluate to true.
  If these conditions are not met, the result of these algorithm calls is undefined.
- ``sort``, ``stable_sort``, ``sort_by_key``, ``partial_sort_copy`` algorithms may work incorrectly or cause
  a segmentation fault when used a DPC++ execution policy for CPU device, and built
  on Linux with Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler and -O0 -g compiler options.
  To avoid the issue, pass ``-fsycl-device-code-split=per_kernel`` option to the compiler.
- Incorrect results may be produced by ``exclusive_scan``, ``inclusive_scan``, ``transform_exclusive_scan``,
  ``transform_inclusive_scan``, ``exclusive_scan_by_segment``, ``inclusive_scan_by_segment``, ``reduce_by_segment``
  with ``unseq`` or ``par_unseq`` policy when compiled by Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler
  with ``-fiopenmp``, ``-fiopenmp-simd``, ``-qopenmp``, ``-qopenmp-simd`` options on Linux.
  To avoid the issue, pass ``-fopenmp`` or ``-fopenmp-simd`` option instead.
- Incorrect results may be produced by ``reduce``, ``reduce_by_segment``, and ``transform_reduce``
  with 64-bit data types when compiled by Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler versions 2021.3 and newer
  and executed on GPU devices.

- ``std::array::at`` member function cannot be used in kernels because it may throw an exception;
  use ``std::array::operator[]`` instead.
- ``std::array`` cannot be swapped in DPC++ kernels with ``std::swap`` function or ``swap`` member function
  in the Microsoft* Visual C++ standard library.
- Due to specifics of Microsoft* Visual C++, some standard floating-point math functions
  (including ``std::ldexp``, ``std::frexp``, ``std::sqrt(std::complex<float>)``) require device support
  for double precision.

.. [#fnote1] The sorting algorithms in oneDPL use Radix sort for arithmetic data types and
   ``sycl::half`` (since oneDPL 2022.6) compared with ``std::less`` or ``std::greater``, otherwise Merge sort.
